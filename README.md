# Python Course Project: Person API

This project is part of the Udemy course [Python 3 do Zero ao Avançado](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-do-zero-ao-avancado/). It demonstrates building a REST API for managing persons using FastAPI, MongoDB, and Docker with modern software architecture patterns.

While I started with the structured course, I found that the early modules covered concepts I had already mastered. To challenge myself and accelerate my learning, I decided to pivot toward building a custom API. This allowed me to focus on high-impact skills and apply the architecture patterns I find most relevant to real-world development.

## Features

- Create, read, and retrieve persons
- Asynchronous operations with Motor (MongoDB async driver)
- Containerized with Docker and Docker Compose
- Clean architecture with CQRS pattern (Commands and Queries)
- Dependency Injection using FastAPI's `Depends`
- Environment-based configuration management
- Type-safe data models with Pydantic

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs with automatic DI
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI
- **Motor**: Asynchronous MongoDB driver
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization
- **Python 3.8+**: Programming language

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-course
   ```

2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

3. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will start MongoDB and the web application.

## Configuration

The application uses environment-based configuration:

- **Development**: Default settings for local development
- **Production**: Uses environment variables for production deployment

### Environment Variables

For production deployment, set the following environment variable:
- `ENV=production`
- `PROD_DB_URL`: MongoDB connection URL for production

## Usage

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /**: Health check
  - Response: `{"Message": "healthy"}`

- **GET /person/{id}**: Get a person by ID
  - Parameters: `id` (string)
  - Response: Person object or 404 if not found

- **GET /person/**: Get all persons
  - Response: List of Person objects

- **POST /person/**: Create a new person
  - Body: JSON with person data (name, age, address, is_pep)
  - Response: Created person's ID

### Person Model

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "age": "integer",
  "address": {
    "street": "string",
    "city": "string",
    "state": "string",
    "zip_code": "string"
  },
  "is_pep": "boolean"
}
```

## Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles with CQRS pattern:

### Dependency Injection
- Uses FastAPI's built-in DI system with `Depends`
- Dependencies are injected from outer layers to inner layers
- Easy to test and maintain

### Layers
- **Presentation Layer** (`main.py`): FastAPI routes and DI setup
- **Application Layer** (`features/`): CQRS handlers (Commands and Queries)
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`infra/`): Database connection and repository implementations
- **Domain Layer** (`models/`): Business entities and validation

```

## Development

To run locally without Docker:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start MongoDB (locally or via Docker)

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Code Quality

- Uses type hints throughout the codebase
- Follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- Implements proper error handling

## Next Steps

This project provides a solid foundation for a Person API. Here are some potential enhancements to consider:

### 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] **Add GitHub Actions pipeline** for automated testing and deployment
- [ ] **Configure VPC deployment** with infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- [ ] **Implement blue-green deployment** strategy for zero-downtime updates
- [ ] **Add automated security scanning** and vulnerability checks

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Implement JWT-based authentication** with FastAPI security
- [ ] **Add role-based access control (RBAC)** for different user permissions
- [ ] **Integrate OAuth2 providers** (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] **Add API key authentication** for service-to-service communication

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- [ ] **Add Mediator pattern** for decoupling command/query handlers
- [ ] **Add caching layer** (Redis) for improved performance
- [ ] **Implement API versioning** for backward compatibility

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Add structured logging** with correlation IDs
- [ ] **Implement health checks** and metrics endpoints

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- [ ] **Set up automated code coverage** reporting
